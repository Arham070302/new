        <h2>why is Dota 2 dying? Let me show you</h2>

        <!--stole most these information from others lol-->

        <p>
            Smurfs account, people buying accounts, even more and more trolls, Feeders and a useless report system.
Every day is more regular among players the feeling that Dota 2 Matchmaking is <strong>broken</strong>(And is not Wrong), rage and toxicity as risen to new levels, trolls and feeders are just laughting about being reported.
Why? Because the report system is useless, the only thing that Valve cares is about selling chests and Dota 2 Plus subscriptions.
After years and years of working in this game, how is it posible that they can fix what is ruining Dota 2? Every day more people uninstall Dota 2 because they hate the community and eventually they begging hating the game and the company that made it.
Valve keep trying to make everything automatic, but they actually need some modders watching random games searching for trolls, feeders and boosters and just Ban the Account. Reports needs to affect MMR.
If you dont belive what im saying i will give you some proof. This is not something strange to find, i find many cases every week.
